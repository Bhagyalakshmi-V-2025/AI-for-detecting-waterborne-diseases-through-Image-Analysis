The detection of waterborne pathogens is essential for safeguarding public 
health, especially in regions with limited access to clean and safe water. 
Traditional methods of microorganism detection often rely on time-consuming 
and resource-intensive laboratory techniques. To address this, the present study 
introduces an artificial intelligence-based solution using the YOLOv5 deep 
learning algorithm to detect and classify microorganisms in water samples. The 
model is trained on the Environmental Microorganism Dataset (EMDS-7), which 
comprises a comprehensive collection of labelled images representing 41 distinct 
microorganism types. YOLOv5 is chosen for its high-speed real-time object 
detection capabilities and accuracy. This approach significantly reduces the 
reliance on manual processes, enabling faster, automated, and scalable pathogen 
detection. Experimental results demonstrate a high level of precision, indicating 
the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The proposed system holds 
strong potential for public health surveillance, particularly in underserved or 
remote areas where rapid diagnosis and response are critical to preventing the 
spread of waterborne diseases. 

I have uploaded the Yolov5 ipynb file in zip format since the file size was very big . when you click on that zip file , it takes you to a page called 'view raw' . click on that to download zip . Once downloaded.
